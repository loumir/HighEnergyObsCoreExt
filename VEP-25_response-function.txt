New Term: response-function
Action: Addition 
Label: response-function
Description:  
A data product type describing instrumental response functions for calibration and analysis. 

Relationships: response-function is a top level term.
Usually related to an event-list data product in high energy astrophysics.

Used-in: Data sets made accessible via the Chandra CS2 catalog 

Rationale:
The distribution of event-list data in multi-messenger astronomy. 
For example, Chandra primary products distributed via the Chandra
Data Archive include around half a dozen different types of products neces-
sary to analyse Chandra data (for example, L2 event-list, Aspect solution,
bad pixel map, spacecraft ephemeris, V&V Report).
For VHE gamma rays and neutrinos, the DL3 event-lists should manda-
torily be associated to their associated IRFs files. The links between the
event-list and these IRFs should be well defined in the event-bundle.

New Term: Point Spread Function
Action: Addition 
Label: psf
Description: A dataset that records the probability density function of 
spatial/angular spreading of incident photons from a point source caused 
by the instrument (detector and/or mirror and/or analysis)

Relationships: narrower than #response-function

Used-in: CTA example?  


----------
New Term: Effective Area
Action: Addition 
Label: aeff 
Description: A dataset that records the “effective area” of a telescope
and/or instrument. The effective area is the geometric area
of the telescope and/or instrument reduced by efficiency factors 
such as reflectivity and vignetting, among other effects

Relationships: narrower than #response-function
----------
New Term: Ancillary Response File
Action: Addition 
Label: arf 
Description: A dataset that records the
combined telescope/instru-
ment effective area and
detector quantum efficiency as
a function of energy

Relationships: narrower than #response-function

Used-in: XMM data products ?

---------- 
New Term: Background Rate
Action: Addition 
Label: bkgrate 
Description: A dataset that models the rate of residual events that are
not from the expected source type (e.g. for gamma-ray instrument it 
measures residual non-gamma-ray events coming.

Relationships: narrower than #response-function

----------
New Term: Energy Dispersion 
Action: Addition 
Label: edisp 
Description: A dataset that records the
probability density of detecting an event with an energy estimator given the true
energy of the event. 

Relationships: narrower than #response-function

Used-in: HESS data products ? 

----------
New Term: Redistribution Matrix File 
Action: Addition 
Label: rmf 
Description: A dataset that records the probability density function
mapping from energy space into detector pulse height (or position) space

Relationships: narrower than #response-function

Used-in: Chandra response data products ?
